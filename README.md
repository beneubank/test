## Observations and learnings
### July 29th, 2017
I don’t really know what any of this means! But I completed the exercise and customized it to my liking!

Also, in the videos, the instructor’s text editor uses a JS-autocomplete function. I’m deciding not to install one of those at this point in time. Typing the code out in full, however verbose and with whatever likelihood of messing up a `)};` by hand, is a better practice for me to get familiar with the syntax.

## To do
### Support for click or touch events (as well as keyboard presses)
I want to include this somehow… otherwise it feels kind of pointless as a project beyond a learning exercise! As I was rewriting my CSS, I instinctively included styling for small screens (mobile-first), but that little viewport styling is only good if your computer browser window is small. 😂 I know adding support for _pointer events_ involves things like `click`, `mousedown`, `touchstart`… and I *think* those ”things” are, more technically, `events` I `bind` a `function` to…?! But it’s not as simple as including them alongside `keydown` in the `window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound);` thingy. (👈 That thingy is called a `method`. I just Googled it.)
